
## Summary

A minimalist HF receiver


## Description

This is a direct conversion receiver that uses a quadrature sampling detector (AKA Tayloe detector) to mix the RF down to audio baseband. Demodulation and DSP operations are done by an Atmega328 processor and software development uses the Arduino IDE. The receiver is implemented on a single circuit board with dimensions of 75mm x 55mm (2.9" x 2.1").
